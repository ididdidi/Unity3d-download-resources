# Unity3d-download-resources
This repository contains code examples for loading resources into a Unity project over the Internet.

Currently the following are examples:
* Download Asset Bundles(loading prefab)
* Download VideoClip

> Attention! When loading a prefab, you must also load the materials used by it!

The project source code contains the [Unity3d-Network](https://github.com/mofrison/Unity3d-Network) repository as a submodule it is the core of the project.

## Installation
To avoid problems with missing submodule files, I recommend cloning this repository recursively

	git clone https://github.com/mofrison/Unity3d-download-resources --recursive

Thank you for reading to the end, I hope this will be useful to you :)
